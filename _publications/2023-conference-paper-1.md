The increasing popularity of VR games has sparked a notable surge in interest toward VR exergames, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To uphold the quality of VR exergames and provide valuable feedback to developers, it is imperative to consider the perspectives and concerns of players regarding VR exergames and conduct a comprehensive analysis of their reviews. This study employs the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to effectively discern various topics within reviews, thus elucidating playersâ€™ reservations concerning VR exergames. Empirical investigations were conducted using a dataset comprising 15,917 English-language reviews of 16 VR exergames on the Steam platform. The experimental findings unequivocally indicate that players exhibit a favorable disposition toward VR exergames (88.31% vs. 11.69%). The analysis encompasses eight distinct topics including user experience, graphics, music, and gameplay.
