This paper investigates the phenomenon of sexual harassment within social virtual reality environments, focusing on its impact on various demographic groups, including women, children and teenagers, and LGBTQIA+ individuals. Through a systematic review of existing literature and case studies, the analysis highlights the unique challenges posed by the immersive and embodied nature of social virtual reality, which can intensify the experience of sexual harassment compared to traditional online interactions. The findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions, enhanced platform governance, and user education to mitigate these risks. Key recommendations include the implementation of more intuitive reporting mechanisms, safety-focused design features, and clear community guidelines. The paper also outlines future research directions to address the evolving dynamics of sexual harassment in social virtual reality, aiming to foster safer and more supportive virtual environments.
