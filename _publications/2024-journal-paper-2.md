In recent years, the boom of Virtual Reality (VR) technology has signaled fruitful applications in various fields, such as education, industry, animation, entertainment, game, and so forth. The global VR games market is projected to grow to $53.44 billion in 2028 at a CAGR of 31.4% in the 2021-2028 period. Therefore, what players care about most about VR games is a topic worthy of research. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of 1362 VR games and 484070 reviews on the Steam platform. Unlike other literature focusing only on monolingual reviews (such as English), we apply the topic clustering model (BERTopic) to comprehensively analyze multilingual user reviews, including English, Simplified Chinese, and French. We find that the three features people praise the most are the music, the gaming experience, and the gameplay. Meanwhile, gamersâ€™ most common complaints are bug issues, insufficient content, and excessive pricing.
