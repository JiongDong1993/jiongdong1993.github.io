Virtual reality (VR) technology is gaining popularity in a variety of fields, including education, games, movies, medicine, and engineering, to name a few. 360∘∘ VR video could provide an immersive experience and attract more researchers’ and developers’ attention. Some literature focused on the head movement when users watched 360∘∘ videos and released head tracking datasets. With the popularity of VR games, how the game contexts influence players’ head movement and the effect of head movement on VR sickness is a topic worth studying. In this article, we collected a head movement dataset of 30 participants while playing five different VR games (Aircar, Beat Saber, Moss, Arizona Sunshine, and SUPERHOT), and the participants filled the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) after playing VR games. Finally, we analyzed the SSQ scores and the impact of VR games on VR sickness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first available head movement trajectory dataset based on playing several types of VR games.
